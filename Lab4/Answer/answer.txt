1.if in equals method of Media and Track class, we pass the Object which is not Media or Track Object, what happens?
It can be bug when type casting, we cannot cast other Object type to Media or Track if they are not relationship.

2.Question: Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the information of this interface.  
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach. 
What class should implement the Comparable interface? 
In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
there 2 variable were be passed in compare, and if the value of va1>va2, va1 is the next of va2 in list, we can replace when we want to sort contrary.

Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach? 
yes, we can
Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this? 
i can use condition relying on order of priority.
